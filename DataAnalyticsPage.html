			<h2>Electric Vehicle Preference Data updated 2023</h2>
			<p>This data set provided by kaggle.com was interesting to me because it is about the popularity of EV's in different parts of the USA. This data could be used to target certain areas with your EV. This is also very important information for city planners and the DOT to begin planning on putting in charging stations to keep up with the growing demand. This information could also help future invenstors in the industry.</p>

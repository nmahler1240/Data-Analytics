			<h2>Movie Data 2012-2016</h2>
			<p>For this practice I used google sheet with Chat GPT integrated to clean and sort the data. I then imported the data into Looker. For the "Profit" field I created a custom field in Looker that calculated the total profit from the film budget and the box office revenue. The interative page that I have created is a great way to look at historical data to make predictions on what movies will be popular in the future. For example, according to this data the most profitable movie genre from 2012 - 2016 was Action and in the past years since we have seen a huge rise in that type of movie being produced.</p>

			<h2>Electric Vehicle Preference Data updated 2023</h2>
			<p>This data set provided by kaggle.com was interesting to me because it is about the popularity of EV's in different parts of the USA. This data could be used to target certain areas with your EV. This is also very important information for city planners and the DOT to begin planning on putting in charging stations to keep up with the growing demand. This information could also help future invenstors in the industry.</p>
